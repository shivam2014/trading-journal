## Implementation Details

### Pattern Detection
```typescript
interface PatternDetection {
  type: 'bullish' | 'bearish' | 'neutral';
  pattern: string;
  startIndex: number;
  endIndex: number;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Indicator Calculation
```typescript
interface IndicatorValue {
  timestamp: number;
  value: number | number[];
  metadata?: {
    upperBand?: number;
    lowerBand?: number;
    signal?: number;
  };
}

interface IndicatorConfig {
  type: string;
  parameters: {
    period?: number;
    stdDev?: number;
    fastPeriod?: number;
    slowPeriod?: number;
    signalPeriod?: number;
  };
}
```

### WebSocket Integration
- Real-time pattern notifications
- Automatic recalculation on new data
- Confidence-based filtering
- Rate-limited updates

## Trade Pattern Analysis

### Entry Patterns
1. **Momentum Entry**
   - RSI crossing 30/70
   - MACD crossover
   - Bollinger Band bounce

2. **Trend Following Entry**
   - Moving Average crossover
   - Break of support/resistance
   - Pattern breakout

3. **Reversal Entry**
   - Double bottom/top completion
   - Head and shoulders breakout
   - Candlestick reversal patterns

### Exit Patterns
1. **Technical Exits**
   - Moving average crossover
   - RSI overbought/oversold
   - Pattern completion

2. **Trailing Stops**
   - ATR-based
   - Swing high/low
   - Moving average based

### Risk Management
1. **Position Sizing**
   - ATR-based sizing
   - Percentage risk
   - Fixed fractional

2. **Stop Loss Placement**
   - Pattern-based stops
   - Indicator-based stops
   - Time-based stops

## Integration with Trading Journal

### Pattern Recording
- Automatically detect and record patterns present during trade entry/exit
- Calculate success rate for each pattern type
- Track pattern reliability across different market conditions

### Performance Analysis
- Correlation between patterns and trade outcomes
- Pattern-based win rate calculation
- Risk-adjusted returns by pattern type

### Reporting
- Pattern occurrence frequency
- Success rate by pattern type
- Risk/reward ratio by pattern
- Market condition correlation

## API Integration

### TA-Lib Functions
```typescript
// Example TA-Lib integration
interface TALibConfig {
  pattern: string;
  function: string;
  parameters: {
    high: number[];
    low: number[];
    close: number[];
    volume?: number[];
    period?: number;
  };
}
```
